# sample_code_for_lastools_processing
This code is a sample for processing UAV based point cloud data using LAStools to generate Digital Terrain Model (DTM). 


Its primary objective is to generate a clean Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from the surveyed area. The point cloud data is derived from UAV imagery. This code can help in efficiently dealing with point cloud data and generating accurate terrain models. It utilizes multi-threading capabilities of the PC and is primarily command-line based, allowing for faster processing and ease of use.
